# Simplify3D Profiles for the TAZ 6

These are printing profiles for the Taz 6 printer using Simplify3D. Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests.

If you are going to make a pull request please make a directory under examples with STLs plus before and after photos demonstrating your great work.

Right now only the eSUN PLA is consistent. If you need the Village Plastics or IC3D ABS, use with caution!! They are here as place holders and not usable at this time.

I will have some exmaples and photos to show progress on each profile.
